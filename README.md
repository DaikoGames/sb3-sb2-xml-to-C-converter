# sb3-sb2-xml-to-Csharp-converter
A converter that uses sb3/sb2/xml(Snapinator) files to convert Projects from Scratch to C# - atleast that it the idea
.sb3 and .sb2 Files are supportet. Using sb1 Files is not recommended (didnÂ´t implement that (too hard for me)), use .xml files instead.
When you use the Project now you need Visual Studio, and you can only convert from  sb3/sb2/xml to json  - it is currently a pre beta, in the future it will be a exe file probably
